Patched DSDT detected! Now you should do the following:

1. Remove your current DSDT.aml.
2. Only for 4x40s models with Sandy Bridge CPU installed: copy Mini-SSDT-IMEI.aml from your desktop to /Extra and name it ssdt-1.aml, if you already have existing ssdt.aml or ssdt.aml, if you don't have such.
3. Reboot your laptop.
4. Run the ProBook Installer and select your DSDT options again.

Note: for those of you with ProBook 47x0s (1600x900) or with ProBook 45x0s with 1080p screen mod, you won't be able to boot your system without DSDT.aml!
Instead, you should do the following:

1. Remove your current DSDT.aml.
2.1 If you already have an /Extra/SSDT.aml installed (eg. you already ran the Probook Installer previously), copy Mini-SSDT-DualLink.aml from your desktop to /Extra/ssdt-1.aml.
2.2 If you don't have an /Extra/SSDT.aml installed (eg. fresh install or ??? or you're doing this with Unibeast installer), copy Mini-SSDT-DualLink.aml from your desktop to /Extra/ssdt.aml.
3. Only for 4x40s models with Sandy Bridge CPU installed: copy Mini-SSDT-IMEI.aml from your desktop to /Extra and name it ssdt-2.aml, if you have followed step 2.1 and ssdt-1.aml, if you have followed step 2.2.
4. Reboot your laptop.
5. Run the ProBook Installer and select your DSDT options again.
