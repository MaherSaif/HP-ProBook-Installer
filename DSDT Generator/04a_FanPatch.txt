# This fan patch adds a very conservative modification to the normal
# BIOS fan control.  It does not attempt to trick the system into
# thinking that the laptop is arbitrarily cool.  Instead it simply
# avoids some of the annoying ways in which the default HP BIOS
# controls the fan.  Primarily that it ramps up the fan speed too
# agressively, and even when at relatively cool temperatures, it
# runs the fan at one speed above the lowest.
#

# add fan readings and fan control
